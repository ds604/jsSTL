jsSTL
=====

jsSTL is an implementation of C++'s STL algorithms as extensions
to the prototypical Javascriptr Array. The algorithms are implemented
on the Array prototype for simplicity and since Javascript does not
yet have real containers other than Array. Because of this lack of 
containers I have chosen to use array indices as the iterators.

This is a work in progress and not all algorithms have been
implemented. Those that have have not yet been tested for
correctness but will be soon.
