jsSTL
=====

jsSTL is an implementation of C++'s STL algorithms as extensions
to the prototypical Javascriptr Array. The algorithms are implemented
on the Array prototype for simplicity and since Javascript does not
yet have real containers other than Array. Because of this lack of 
containers I have chosen to use array indices as the iterators.

This is a work in progress and not all algorithms have been
implemented. index.html contains usage examples for the algorithms and
predicates that have been implemented.
